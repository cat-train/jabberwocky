			<h1>The Jabberwocky</h1>
			<div>
				<p>Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), "Through the Looking-Glass"</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
				<p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</p>
				<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
				<p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>
				<p>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>
				<p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</p>
				<p>The frumious Bandersnatch!'</p>
			</div>
			<script>alert('debug, is this working?');</script>
			<div>
				<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:</p>
				<p>Long time the manxome foe he sought--</p>
				<p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,</p>
				<p>And stood awhile in thought.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>And as in uffish thought he stood,</p>
				<p>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</p>
				<p>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</p>
				<p>And burbled as it came!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through</p>
				<p>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</p>
				<p>He left it dead, and with its head</p>
				<p>He went galumphing back.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?</p>
				<p>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</p>
				<p>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'</p>
				<p>He chortled in his joy.</p>
