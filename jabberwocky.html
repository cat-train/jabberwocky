				<p>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</p>
				<p>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</p>
				<p>All mimsy were the borogoves,</p>
				<p>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</p>
				<p>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</p>
				<p>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</p>
				<p>The frumious Bandersnatch!'</p>

				<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:</p>
				<p>Long time the manxome foe he sought--</p>
				<p>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,</p>
				<p>And stood awhile in thought.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>And as in uffish thought he stood,</p>
				<p>The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</p>
				<p>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</p>
				<p>And burbled as it came!</p>
